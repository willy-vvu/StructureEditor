# Structure Editor

A prototype Scheme editor that edits the structure of code, rather than text. As a result, the notion of "syntax errors" becomes nonexistent, if not replaced by productive, creative accidents that maintain programmer flow.

When programmers actually edit their code, they’re not just typing and deleting characters. They’re trying to match up a rich, hierarchical, interconnected, underlying model in their head with an intermediate text form in front of them, which eventually gets translated back into something akin to the cognitive model. Unfortunately, the use of text is a vestige of typewriters and punchcards. Higher order structures suddenly become delicate, fragile, and brittle, when converted to and from text -- as any novice programmer will recount how many errors they’ve received from a compiler about a forgotten semicolon or bracket. Directly editing of the tree form of code, only recently made possible with better processing power and interaction technologies, is a largely unexplored territory as it requires leaving the comfortable textual model behind.
